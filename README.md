# YogaGuide_Project
This is a simple website to guide people for doing basic yoga for their better health.It basically have three interfaces.
<br>
Technology stack: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).
<br>
Working:- 
<br>
First interface is the starting window.
By clicking on start button, we will move to 2nd inteface.
<br>
Second Interface have list of different yoga posture. 
We can select any of them, and we get to how to do it.
<br>
Third interface show only the picture of the picture.
<br>
Features: -
I add a icon button also, that tells the some additional information about that Asana(Posture).
While making it I face some challenges like balancing the size ratio, and adding the pop-up animation. 
And Each yoga pose has unique steps + benefits.
To avoid long static HTML, had to store them in JavaScript objects and load dynamically.
But overall it's a good experience and I learned a lot while making this project.
